# B::enchmark [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/busyloop/b.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/busyloop/b) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/busyloop/b.png)](https://gemnasium.com/busyloop/b) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/b.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/b)

A small, convenient benchmark-library.

## Features

* Displays relative performance; "B was 1.4x slower than A"

* Returns benchmark-results as Array of Hashes (for easy integration with your unit-tests or CI)

* Output can be customized with a simple Plugin-API (ships with plugins for TSV and HTML)

* High precision (via [hitimes](https://github.com/copiousfreetime/hitimes))


## Installation

`gem install b`

## Example

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'b'

B.enchmark('Sleep "performance"', :rounds => 10, :compare => :mean) do
  job '300ms' do
    sleep 0.3
  end

  job '100ms' do
    sleep 0.1
  end

  job '200ms' do
    sleep 0.2
  end
end
```

### Output:

```
-- Sleep "performance" ---------------------------------------------------------------
        rounds         r/s        mean         max         min    Â± stddev      x mean
